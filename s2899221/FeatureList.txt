IMPLEMENTED
- Ray tracing core: Sphere, Cube, Cylinder, Plane primitives
- BVH acceleration structure (optional via --bvh) for faster intersection and shadow queries
- Camera: perspective model, focal length, sensor size, resolution (from JSON)
- Materials: baseColor (RGB or ImageTexture), metallic, roughness, IOR, alpha (opacity)
- Texture support: base color image sampling with UVs; automatic path resolution from Blender export (BMP fallback)
- Lighting: point lights with inverse-square attenuation
- Shading: Lambert diffuse + normalized Blinn-Phong specular (roughness maps to shininess)
- Shadows: hard shadows with transparency-aware transmittance along shadow rays
- Reflections/Refractions: mirror reflection and Snell refraction with Schlick Fresnel mix
- Roughness-based glossy reflection blur (distributed sampling), configurable via --roughSamples
- Anti-aliasing: stochastic samples per pixel (--spp)
- Recursion control: --maxDepth for reflection/refraction depth
- Deterministic RNG sampling passed through recursive bounces
- Uniform background color
- CLI app (rt_render): --bvh, --spp N, --maxDepth N, --roughSamples N, --minThroughput f, --no-rr
- Scene loader (JSON): camera, lights, meshes and materials; TRS and quaternion rotations; Blender scale alignment
- Plane meshes can be specified by 4 world-space corners
- AABB bounds computed and transformed for accelerated traversal
- Export script (Blend/Export.py): exports Blender scenes to JSON (camera, point lights, primitives, materials incl. baseColor/metallic/roughness/IOR/alpha, optional image texture path)
- Batch script(s): example render runner (render_test1.bat) to invoke rt_render with typical flags

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
- Soft Shadows
- Motion Blur
